# Power BI: Bar chart Drill Down

- A bar chart drill-down allows users to click on a data point (such as a bar in the chart) and view more detailed data associated with that specific point. In essence, it creates a hierarchy of data levels, where each level presents data at a different level of granularity.
### Structure and Layers of Drill-Down
- Main Layer (Summary Level): The first layer of the bar chart usually shows aggregated or summary data, such as total sales by product category.
- Drill-Down Layer (Detailed View): When a user clicks on a specific bar (e.g., a category of products), Power BI zooms in on that data point and reveals a more detailed layer. For example, total sales could break down into sales by product within that category.
